# UKMap_D3_2609757
  This project aims to create an interactive web-based UK map using D3.js, featuring dynamic elements like plottable towns, a measurement mode, and a visualization of distances between towns. Leveraging D3.js and TopoJSON libraries, the map provides a rich and engaging user experience. 
  
  In measurement mode, users can visualize geographical distances between towns. The Haversine formula calculates these distances, and the results are animated on the map through strokes connecting the relevant points.
  
  An additional highlight is the application's capability to download distance data between all plotted towns in CSV or JSON formats. This functionality enhances the project's utility for further analysis, data exploration, and potential applications in Geographical Information Systems, especially in handling substantial datasets.
  
  A notable contribution to the project is the inclusion of ukcounties.json, a comprehensive file containing all counties in the UK. The Isle of Man has been distinctly identified as such based on its reference within the JSON feed.
